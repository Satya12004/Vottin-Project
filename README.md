Vottin Project

Vottin is a full-stack polling and voting web application. 
Admins can create and manage polls, while users can participate and vote. 
The frontend is built with React, and the backend is powered by Node.js and Express. 
MongoDB Atlas is used as the database to store polls and votes.



Why MERN stack was used:

Full-stack JavaScript

Frontend (React), Backend (Node.js + Express), and Database (MongoDB) all use JavaScript/JSON.

Using a single language makes development faster and easier.

React for Frontend

Allows building a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA).



Large community and libraries available for MERN stack.

Easy to add new features in the future.
